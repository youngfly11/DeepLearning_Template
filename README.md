# Code Framework for improving efficiency
## working in progress
This frame work provide some basic function for training a deep neural network.

-[x] visdom for visualizing traing loss and training accuracy.  
-[x] save checkpoints.   
-[x] adjust learning rate.  
-[x] resume from existing pretrained models of every epoch.   
-[x] global logging.    
-[ ] training log, test log.
